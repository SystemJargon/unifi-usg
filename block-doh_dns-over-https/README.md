Notes:

* Large IP list won't load, it isn't like a proper BSD driven router with ipset method/s.
* If using a < 10 list of IP as an example, the method still seems to brick a unit in most (if not all) cases.
* address-group doh-group-iplist, not to use a name as 'random 25 character alphanumeric group' will apply.
* BSD can support this, not Unifi in this method from initial testing.
